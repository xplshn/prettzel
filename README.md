# prettzel
Dead-simple Go program to give you an appropiate symbol for a percentage.
Here's an example:
```
]/Documents/TrulyMine/prettzel @ ./prettzel --set "ğŸŒ‘ ğŸŒ˜ ğŸŒ— ğŸŒ” ğŸŒ– ğŸŒ•" 20%
ğŸŒ˜
]/Documents/TrulyMine/prettzel @
```
I use this in my baraction.sh script for SpectrWM's included bar program, so I thought I'd share, it works perfectly for displaying volume indicators, battery indicators, brightness, and so on.
